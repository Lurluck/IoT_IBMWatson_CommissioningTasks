# IoT, IBM Watson, Commissioning Tasks
IoT Internet of Things. IBM Watson IoT is one of the worldwide most popular IoT platforms. I am publishing here a set of guides for experimenting with IoT and IoT platforms. The guides are called Commissioning Tasks because those guide you to set up the environment. The environment can be used by students on course works, by developers for learning the fundamentals of IoT and so on. 

The commissioning tasks have been tested with Students of HAMK University of Applied Sciences in Finland both in normal classes and as well on online courses. Some tasks have been tested with people from Industry, some tasks with students in Brazil in Universidade Feevale, some tasks on coures organized as joint implementation by two to four universities of applied sciences. The development of joint implementation of courses has been supported by ESF 2014-2020 Vipuvoimaa EU:lta 2014-2020.

Some tasks require access to certain hardware and suitable laboratory environment. 

The files in this repo:

... .pdf = instructions for commissioning.

... .ino = code files for Arduino MKR1000 processor board + Digilent pmod sensor modules.

...flow.txt = code files for NodeRED flows.

For a short overview please have a look on document IoT_InternetOfThings_SystemOverview_EN_v1.pdf
